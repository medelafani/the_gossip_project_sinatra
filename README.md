# the_gossip_project_sinatra

This project is an introduction to Sinatra, running a local server, trying to upload a previous project from the terminal to a web page (previous project accessible here: https://github.com/Balbader/THP_The_Gossip_Project). 

I've managed to build the MVC architecture, created 2 .erb files, add new gossips to the database and redirect to the home page.
